# Learning Python
This is my introduction to programming and GitHub exercises
This is my first year into programming; I have chosen Python for its ease of use and simplicity.
I am learning through LinkedIn Learning courses, online resources, and books.
I have a lot to learn but above all else, I need to learn exposure!
In order to work for companies I need them to know that I have no problem showing off what I've learned and the mistakes I've made along the way.
